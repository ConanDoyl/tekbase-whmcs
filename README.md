## Summary
With this module you're able to manage your customer licenses. You can add, delete, lock/unlock or upgrade a license. 
The Module requires at least one product, we prefer to create both types.

This Module has been written by me, Thomas Brinkmann. I'm a Developer and System-Administrator of [DeinServerHost.de](https://DeinServerHost.de).
We're working together with TekBase so this module became the Official TekBase WHMCS Module.

If you need help with the Module or TekBase itself, you can create a issue here on Github (Only for help for this module) or creating a topic in the [TekBase Forum](https://community.teklab.de).
